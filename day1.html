        <p class="underline">Computer data</p> 
        <p>Data can exist in a variety of forms - as numbers or text on pieces of paper, as bits and bytes stored in electronic memory, or as facts stored in a person's mind.
        Computer data is information processed or stored by a computer.
        Computer data may be processed by the computer's CPU and is stored in files and folders on the computer's hard-disk.</p>
        <p class="underline">Information</p>
        <p>Information is an organized collection of realted data which gives a complete sense. 
        It also involves manipulation of raw data. 
        Information is obtained by assembling items of data into a meaningful form.
    For example: If we take Deekshit, student, 17 year as data then "Deekshit is a student. He is 17 years old." is an information</p>
        <p class="underline">Databse</p>
        <p>Often abbreviated as DB, a database is basically a collection of information organized in such a way that a computer program can quickly select desired pieces of data.
            A database is a collection of related dara organized in way that data can be easily accessed,
            managed and updated. For example, customer record, telephone diary, result sheet. 
            Database is actually a place where realted piece of information is stored and various operations can be performed on it.
        </p>
        <p class="underline">DBMS</p>
        <p>A DBMS is a software that allows creation, definition and manipulation of database.
            DBMS is actually a tool used to perform any kind of opertaion on data in database.
            DBMS also provides protection and security to databasee. It maintains data consistency in case of multiple users.
            Here are some examples of popular DBMS: MySQL, Oracle, Sybase, Microsoft Access and IBM DB2 etc.
            <br><br>
            A Database Management System(DBMS) is the softwarethat allows a computer to perform databasefunctions of storing, retriving, adding, deleting and modifying data.
            There are many different types of database management systems, running from small systems that run on physical computers to huge systems that run on mainframes.
